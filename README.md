 This is a basic script written in **Node.js** to find random, available Minecraft usernames.

# Installation:
>> You Must Have Node.js & npm installed. Install Them At https://nodejs.org/en/download
1. Clone or download this repository on your computer.
2. Using your terminal or command line, enter the repo folder.
3. Run command `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Run `node index` to start the program.
This will begin printing usernames followed by the length of the username into the command window in the format of `<username> - <length>` 

__Note: it may take time for the usernames to start printing and it may take longer then 1 second between each name as if a name is taken already it will not print it and it will still take time. Also, some usernames that are displayed may not be available right away. You can check this on https://namemc.com__
